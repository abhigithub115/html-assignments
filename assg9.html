        <p>A computer is a machine or device that performs processes, calculations and operations based on instructions provided by a software or hardware program. It is designed to execute applications and provides a variety of solutions by combining integrated hardware and software components.A computer is a machine or device that performs processes, calculations and operations based on instructions provided by a software or hardware program.

           <p>
             CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. It is also known as a brain of the computer. It carries out instructions and computer programs and performs all the basic arithmetical and logical operations. CPU is installed in the motherboard on a specific area known as CPU socket.

           <b><a id="alu">ALU</a></b>
           <p>
             An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs. In addition to ALUs, modern CPUs contain a control unit (CU)

           <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
              <p>A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal.</p>
              <b><a id="c">C</a></b>
              <p>
                 C is a high-level and general-purpose programming language that is ideal for developing firmware or portable applications. Originally intended for writing system software, C was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix Operating System in the early 1970s.
              </p>
              <b><a id="c++">C<sup>++</sup></a></b>
              <p>
                r C++ compilers may be written in other languages. The first C++ compiler (Cfront) was written in C++. To build that, I first used C to write a ``C with Classes''-to-C preprocessor. ``C with Classes'' was a C dialect that became the immediate ancestor to C++.

              <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
                 <p>A database management system (DBMS) is system software for creating and managing databases. The DBMS provides users and programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update and manage data.A DBMS makes it possible for end users to create, read, update and delete data in a database.</p>
                 <b><a id="r">RDMS</a></b>
                 <p> 
                    The RDMS credential is designed to certify competence in the field of diagnostic medical sonography. By earning the RDMS credential, healthcare professionals gain a critical edge in promoting public safety in ultrasound.

                 <p>
                     OODBMS stands for Object-Oriented Database Management System. An object-oriented database management system
                     (also known simply as an object database ) is a DBMS where data is represented in the form of objects,
                     as used in object-oriented programming

                        A record in the hierarchical database model corresponds to a row in the relational database model
